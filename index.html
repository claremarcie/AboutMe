                <h1> Hi, I'm Clare! </h1>
                <p> I'm 28 years old — A Capricorn, born December 26, which is also my mum's birthday! </p>
                <p> I live in Victoria, BC but grew up in Calgary, AB — Yeehaw! I've also lived in Toronto, ON and Vancouver, BC. </p>
                <p> I identify as an introvert and come across as shy and reserved at first, but those who know me see my goofy and nerdy side. I'm determined, type-A, sarcastic, family-oriented, and loyal. </p>

                <p> I've been dating my partner, Coen, for 3 years. He works as a nurse! </p>
                <p> I have a younger sister, Shea. She's a certified therapist and helps me with all my problems! </p>
                <p> My family dog, Rudy, is one of the loves of my life – Even though his breath smells like anchovies. </p>

            <p> I love fancy coffee, dachshunds (of all kinds), fantasy reads, bad reality TV, and cinnamon buns! </p>
            <p> My perfect day off would include sleeping in, a long walk with a stop for a sweet treat, a trip to the bookstore (with an unlimited budget), and cooking dinner with Coen. </p>
